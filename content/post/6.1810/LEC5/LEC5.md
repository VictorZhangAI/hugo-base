## GDB

step: one line of code at a time, jumps into the function  
next: jump over functions  
stepi, nexti: do same thing for asm code  
continue: run until next breakpoint  
finish: runs until the function ends  

break: set a breakpoint  
watch: stop whenever value changes  
x: prints the raw memory  
print: prints the expression  
info registers: print value of registers  
info frame: prints current stack frame  

set: change value of a variable  

## Handout 5

overwrite return address will cause an infinite loop  

## Calling Conventions

int in RISC-V is always 32-bit wide, while long is 32-bit wide in RV32 and 64-bit wide in RV64  
in RV64, int is sign-extended  
struct: pass first 8 pointer-words into register  
twice size as a pointer word: use an even-odd pair; more than twice: pass by reference  

## Lecture 5

since published, x86 adds 3 instructions per month  
```assembly
.section .test
.global sum_to
```

definition of .test is at \<defs.h\>  

focus: switch the layout window in gdb  

tmux:
C-b c: new window  
C-b p & C-b n: switch between terminals  
C-b %: vertical split  
C-b ": horizontal split  
C-b o: jump between splited windows  

apropos will display gdb built-in manual  

caller: not preserved, callee: preserved  
s0-s11 is for? maybe to give compiler flexibility  

stack frame generated by calls  
sp->bottom of the stack  
fp->top of the current frame  

i frame: show the message of stack frame  
backtrace
